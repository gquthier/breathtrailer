Most Trailers Are Built for Everyone
​Except People Like You
You’ve probably already looked around..

You’ve seen:

Bulky, overbuilt caravans
Cheap imports with poor insulation
Heavy campers that strain small SUVs
Complicated setups
No real design or comfort
You don’t want to tow a 2-ton monster.
You don’t want 45-minute setups.
You don’t want a mobile apartment.
You want something simple, capable, and comfortable.
Something that suits how you actually travel.
A Trailer Should Give You More Freedom —
Not More Decisions to Regret

Why Everything Starts With a Design Session

Most people get stuck because they try to choose a trailer first.

A better approach is to start with how you actually travel:

- Your tow vehicle
- How often you move camps
- How long your trips really are
- What comfort matters — and what doesn’t

When you start there, the right trailer becomes clear.
You avoid overbuying weight and size, underbuying comfort, and ending up with features you don’t use.

A design session gives you clarity on layout, weight, and pricing — before you commit to anything.
No pressure. No obligation.

​Just a clear starting point.

What Most People Want to Know at This Point
Before committing to anything, most people want clarity on price and weight.

For context:

Pricing typically ranges from $19,990 to $37,000
(you only pay for what you need)

Weight ranges from approximately 700 kg up to 1500 kg

All Breath Trailers are hard-shell teardrop campers with minimal setup but size, layout, fit-out, and intended use make a significant difference to both weight and price.

Some people are looking for:
- A lightweight, minimalist teardrop that tows easily behind a small SUV

Others want:
- A larger stand-up teardrop with internal toilet and shower for longer trips
- Or a more capable off-road setup to reach places standard campers can’t

All of these follow the same simple, functional design philosophy but the right choice depends entirely on how you travel.
That’s why guessing rarely works.
The design session is where these ranges become clear and specific to your vehicle, your trips, and your priorities.

Why This Feels Different in Real Use
People often compare trailers, campervans, and imports on paper.

The real differences show up once you start using them.

How Different Camping Options Compare in Real Life

We had the most amazing experience dealing with Breath Trailer, Patricio explain all aspects of the trailer with us and sent videos of ever aspect of the build. We certainly highly recommend Breath trailer for you future adventures.

- ​Colleen Szabo


From the start of the build process it was an absolute pleasure working with the Breath Trailer Team, the customer service throughout the build was second to none, Patricio helped every step of the way, answering all the questions I had & also changes I wanted to the trailer.
All in all great company, outstanding customer service and a beautiful product.
We will definitely be looking into a new trailer build with them again in the future once we have outgrown our Breath Plus.

- ​James Evans


It’s the best little caravan design. It’s so sturdy and well made it will be around making memories long after I hang up my wanderer boots!
The people at Breath put their hearts into designing you a reliable Go Anywhere caravan.
